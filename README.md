# JSON Stream Parser in Rust

This project is a library that provides an incremental JSON parser, built with Rust. It's designed to parse a stream of JSON data, making it suited for situations where you might not have the entire JSON object available when parsing begins â€” for example, in the case of streaming a structured response from a Large Language Model.

ðŸš¨ This project is a work in progress, and is not yet ready for use in production.

## Installation

This project is built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and you'll need `cargo` to get started.

To include JSON Stream Parser in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
json-stream-parser = "0.1.0"
```

Then, run `cargo build` to build your project.

## Usage

If you have an icomplete JSON object, you can parse it incrementally with the `JsonStreamParser` struct. Here's an example:

```rust
use json_stream::JsonStreamParser;

let mut parser = JsonStreamParser::new();
let json = r#"{
  "name": "McLaren F1",
  "top_speed": 240,
  "inspiration": "The McLaren F1 is a sports car designed and manufactured by British automobile manufacturer McLaren Cars and powe"#

for c in json.chars() {
    parser.parse(c);
}

let result = parser.finish();
```

As you can see this object is incomplete, but the parser will still be able to parse it to:

```json
{
  "name": "McLaren F1",
  "top_speed": 240,
  "inspiration": "The McLaren F1 is a sports car designed and manufactured by British automobile manufacturer McLaren Cars and powe"
}
```

## Testing

This project uses `cargo test` to run the tests.
