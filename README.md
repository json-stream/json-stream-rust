# JSON Stream Parser in Rust

This project is a library that provides an incremental JSON parser, built with Rust. It's designed to parse a stream of JSON data, making it suited for situations where you might not have the entire JSON object available when parsing begins â€” for example, in the case of streaming a structured response from a Large Language Model.

## Installation

This project is built with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and you'll need `cargo` to get started.

To include JSON Stream Parser in your project, add the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
json_stream_parser = "0.1.0"
```

Then, run `cargo build` to build your project.

## Usage

To be filled in with example usage code.

## Testing
